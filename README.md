# ai-fashion-mnist
This project was completed by myself for my artificial intelligence class assignment.
The course instructor offered guidance on which convolutional layers should be used, along with each layer's activation type.

Through this project, I learned how to assemble a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras as API for TensorFlow.
This CNN was tasked to classify images from the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).
While the network's parameters were designed by the instructor, it became my duty to assemble and implement the concept in Python using the aforementioned tools.
By printing and analyzing the training and validation accuracy per epoch, I am able to better comprehend the implications of said training.
For example, the growing divergence between the training and validation accuracies may be indicative of an overfitting of the data.
